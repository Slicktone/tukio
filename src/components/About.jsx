                <p>We negotiate discounted tickets for you with event organizers and promoters. You find an event you like and commit to buy the ticket at a discounted price. When enough event goers commit to buy, we buy the tickets. If we don't get enough users, you'll have a chance to buy tickets at the full price.</p>
